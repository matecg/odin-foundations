# Odin Project Curriculum ⚡

> A repository containing all my challenges and projects from Odin Project Full Stack developer curriculum.

📆 **Start date**: *12th of February 2025*

The directory `/fnds` represents the **Foundations Course**, and contain all the code for that curriculum section.

## Foundations

Some notes and comments that pop-up while advancing the Foundations Course.

### Commit Messages

Among the assignments from Foundations there was the reading of [this article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit). I have found it important enough to register the "*Seven rules of a great Git commit message*" here:

1. Separate subject and body with a blank line;
2. Limit the subject line to **50 characters**;
3. Capitalize the subject line;
4. Do not end the subject line with any punctuation;
5. Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line;
6. Wrap the text body at **72 characters**;
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. how;

### Problem Solving

This [amazing article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/) went in details about the most fundamental skill any professional should develop, which is Problem Solving. 

> The art of digesting a problem into tiny manageable parts that, once assembled together, solve the initial task.

The article dives even deeper describing a step-by-step process to be used when facing a challenge, which the author referenced as a `Framework`:

1. **Understand**: study its most important elements, what stand out about it, to a point that one must be able to explain it to anyone. Also have a well known grasp of what the **main goal** is.
   1. It is highly advisable that one must also focus on **removing** everything that is **not essential** for the objective at hand.
2. **Plan**: map your way forward, laying the goal and all the essentials steps that must come together, which steps depend on each other.
3. **Divide**: classify the steps according to their difficulty, start by completing the ones that you are **most comfort** with, and attack them in **isolation**, leaving the task of assembling them to the end.
4. **Research**: Look out for questions, but only for those related with small steps, not for the complete problem.

### Pseudocode

The curriculum also covered an article about Pseudocode, which can also be used a problem solving strategy. Basically it sits between a programming language, using code fundamental building blocks, like conditional statements, loops and so on, and plain English.

Generally, the coding elements are represented with uppercase and indented so they form a block, for example:

```plaintext
SET number to zero
LOOP 10 times:
    INCREMENT number by 1
    IF number is bigger than 4:
        DISPLAY number
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP
```

This is just a simple dummy example that demonstrates all the main features pseudocode generally contain. Notice the indentation and a notation to close a block.
